<p id="description">Online shopping on Myntra currently lacks a social component making it a solitary experience for users. Shoppers often wish to share their favorite finds with friends and family to seek opinions or coordinate joint purchases especially for fashion items. However Myntra does not offer an integrated feature for direct product sharing within the app and getting rewards based on that. This gap in social engagement and lack of incentives for sharing and recommending products results in missed opportunities for enhanced user experience and increased sales through personal recommendations.</p>
